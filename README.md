# Overview
We want to be able to see the usage of Citibikes in NYC. With it being such a big and bustling city, we know there will be a lot of different daya that we can look at. We want to see if this would be a good thing to bring to Iowa. By looking at this data, we will be able to determinine whether or not this would work out in a smaller state like Iowa.

# Results
1) Here we can see that most of the trip durations are between 0 and 1 hour long. 
2) Here we expand on the trip duration model and break it down by gender. Males make up most of the users, then females, then unkown. 
3) We can see that the early morning and late afternoon are most popular for biking during the work week, while most of the whole day is popular on the weekends.
4) This exapands on the previosu model and breaks it apart by gender. We can still see that males are the most commmon users.
5) This visualization shows that male subsribers are the biggest group of users, but subsribers overall make up the majority of users.
6) We can see that there are many different locations to start at, but Manhattan in general is the most popular.
7) Manhattan is also the most popular spot to end at. Very similar to the starting locations map.

# Summary
Based off of these findings, I believe that it would be a good idea to start a biking initiative in Iowa. I think many people in the downtown area of Des Moines would participate. I think that with a good subscription package, it would increase the likelihood of more users joining, especially since the tourism isn't as high in Des Moines as it is in NYC. But overall, I believe that this data shows that there is an interest in the activity and that it could be successful in a different environment. Two other visualizations that I would do with this data is as follows.
 1) I would create a bar chart with the different start stations and the counts of records, and then possibly charging less to start at the less popular locations to try and get more use out of the bikes that are stationed at those locations to decrease the wear and tear on the bikes at the most popular locations.
 2) I would create a visualization that shows the user types on the y-axis and the birth year on the x-axis and see what the relationship between age and user type is to see if younger or older people tend to be customers or subsribers.
